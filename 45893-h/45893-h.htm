</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap larger">William Gilbert</span>, the
father of electrical science,
was born in Colchester in
1540. Educated at St. John's
College, Cambridge, where
he took his degree as Doctor
of Medicine in 1569, he settled, after four years of
foreign travel, in London in 1573, and was admitted
to the Royal College of Physicians, of which
he became Censor, Treasurer, and, in 1599, President.
He was in February, 1601, appointed personal
Physician to the Queen, whom he attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
in her last illness. He came of a well-known East
Anglian family, and held extensive landed estates
in Essex and Suffolk. He survived the Queen only
eight months, dying November 30th, 1603.</p>

<div class="p2">
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_b_002.jpg" alt="G" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap larger">Gilbert's</span> monumental work, the
<i>De Magnete</i>, published in 1600,
marks an era in magnetic science.
For some four hundred years the
employment of the magnetic needle
in navigation had been known
both in Northern and Southern Europe. While it
is possible that the primitive use of the loadstone
may be ascribed to the Baltic, it is certain that the
employment of a pivotted needle, and the addition
of a rose of the winds as a compass card both originated
in the Mediterranean. The pivotted needle
is described in the Epistle of Peter Peregrinus, written
in 1269; while the earliest known compass-card
marked with the initials of the names of the winds
is that ascribed to Jachobus Giraldis, of 1426, in the
Biblioteca Marciana in Venice. The manner of
use in Elizabethan times of the loadstone and of the
compass may be gathered from Olaus Magnus
(<i>Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</i>, 1555), from
Pedro de Medina (<i>Arte de Nauegar</i>, 1545), Martinus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Cortes (<i>Breve compendio de la sphera</i>, 1556),
Blundevile (<i>Exercises</i>, 1594), Norman (<i>Newe Attractive</i>,
1581), Borough (<i>A discours of the Variation
of the Cumpas</i>, 1581), Pedro Nuñez (<i>Instrumenta
Artis Navigandi</i>, 1592), Barlow (<i>The Navigators
Supply</i>, 1597), Nautonier (<i>Mécometrie de l'Eyman</i>,
1602), and Stevin (<i>Die Havenvinding</i>, 1599).</p>

<p>At the time when steering by the compass was
introduced into navigation, the compass pointed
in Middle Europe so nearly truly to the north that
with the rough instrumental appliances at hand its
deviation from the true north was seldom noticed,
or if noticed ascribed to some error in the setting
of the needle. Later the compass-makers began to
set their needles slightly askew beneath the card,
according to the variation in the place of origin.
Norman (1581) states that those used in the Levant,
made in Sicily, Genoa, or Venice, had the needles
straight, while those used in Denmark and Flanders
had them set at three-quarters of a point, or a
whole point, to the eastward; while those made
in Spain, Portugal, France, and England, had the
needles set half a point to the east. Those for Russia
were set at "three seconds of a point." Gilbert denounced
these devices as tending to obscure the
true facts. Gradually it became recognized, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
after the voyage of Columbus, when the manifest
change in the declination of the needle nearly
caused mutiny of the sailors, that the direction
of the needle differs at different places; and accordingly
navigators began to collect data. The
record of the voyage of Columbus states that during
his second voyage in 1496 he used for steering
the observations made on the declination during
his first voyage. The "secret" of Sebastian Cabot,
which he declared when dying to be a divine revelation
to him, can have been little else than the
idea of using in navigation the local declinations
of the compass. On the other hand, Pedro de
Medina flatly denied the existence of the declination,
adding that if the compass did not show the
pole, the fault lay in the defective construction of
the compass itself. Columbus had found a point
2½° east of Corvo, in the Azores, where there was
"no variation," and other navigators explored the
"agonic" lines which crossed the Atlantic and the
Indian ocean. According to Humboldt, Alonzo
de Santa Cruz in 1530 constructed the first general
variation chart. But along with this development
of practical interest in the subject there grew up
a crop of wild legends to account for the irregularities
observed. The reason why the compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
needle pointed north, and the reason why it did
not point truly north, were alike proclaimed to
be due to the stars, to the influence of spirits, or to
the existence of loadstone mountains of uncertain
locality and of fabulous power. The old traditions
of the Arabian Nights, dressed in a newer setting,
found themselves justified by the insertion in maps
of loadstone rocks, the position of which changed
at the fancy of the chartographer. Ptolemy had
located them in the Manioles; Olaus Magnus declared
them to be under the pole; Garzias ab
Horto situated them in the region of Calcutta.
The map of Johann Ruysch, which adorned the
edition of Ptolemy, publisht at Rome in 1508,
showed four magnetic islands in the Arctic Circle.
Martinus Cortes placed the loadstone mountains
in Sarmatia. Mercator in his great chart depicted
two great rocks rising from the sea to the north
of eastern Siberia, one being drawn on the supposition
that at St. Michael the compass points
due north, while the other is further north on the
supposition that the compass points due north at
Corvo. The map of Cornelius Wytfliet, 1597,
shows the same phantom islands. Blundevile,
writing in 1594 of the now lost map of Peter
Plancius, mentions that he sets down the pole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the loadstone somewhat to southward of the islands
that lie east of Groynelande.</p>

<p>Meantime another significant fact had been discovered
in 1576 by Robert Norman, of Limehouse,
compass-maker, namely, the tendency of the
magnetized needle to dip its northern end downwards.
Noticing this as a circumstance that occasioned
him some trouble in the construction of
his compasses, he thereupon devised a dipping-needle,
and measured the dip, "which for this
Cyty of London I finde by exact obseruations to
be about 71 degrees 50 mynutes." He attributed
both the declination and the dip of the needle to
the existence of a "poynt respective," which the
needle respected or indicated, but toward which it
was not attracted. The first authoritative treatise
on the variation of the compass was the tract by
William Borough, comptroller to the Navy, who
in 1580 found an eastward declination of 11° 15'
at Limehouse. Borough had himself travelled in
northern regions and had found at Vaigats a
westerly declination of 7 degrees, whereas by Norman's
theory of the respective point there should
have been an easterly declination of 49° 22'. The
great navigators were continually bringing home
fresh information. Drake, Lynschoten, Cavendish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Hariot all contributed; as did lesser men such as
Abraham Kendall, sailing-master to Sir Robert
Dudley (the <i>soi-disant</i> Duke of Northumberland),
and afterward companion of Drake in his last
voyage. Teachers of navigation such as Simon
Stevin of Bruges and Edward Wright, lecturer to
the East India Company, might record and tabulate:
but a master-mind was wanting to forge some
larger and consistent doctrine which should afford
a grasp of the whole subject. Such an one arose
in Dr. William Gilbert. Nurtured, as we have
seen, in the Cambridge which had so recently been
the home of Linacre and of Kaye--the Kaye who
founded Caius College--Gilbert had, during his
subsequent sojourn in Italy, conversed with all the
learned men of his time. He had experimented
on the magnet with Fra Paolo Sarpi: he had, there
is reason to think, met Giordano Bruno: he was
the friend and correspondent of Giovanni Francesco
Sagredo. Being a man of means and a bachelor,
he spent money freely upon books, maps, instruments,
minerals, and magnets. For twenty years
he experimented ceaselessly, and read, and wrote
and speculated, and tested his speculations by new
experiments. For eighteen years he kept beside
him the manuscript of his treatise, which in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
year 1600 saw the light under the title of <i>De
Magnete</i>, to which was added the sub-title: <i>magneticisque
corporibus, et de magno magnete tellure,
physiologia nova</i>. That which Gilbert had in fact
perceived, and which none before him had glimpsed
even dimly, was that the globe of the earth itself
acted as a great loadstone, and that the tendency
of the needle to point in a polar direction was due
to the globe acting as a whole. So he boldly put
into his title-page the statement that his new philosophy
was concerning the great magnet the earth:
and in chapter after chapter he set himself to
describe the experiments upon which he founded
his famous induction. The phrase <i>terrestrial magnetism</i>
does not occur in any of the prior treatises,
because the idea had not presented itself. Gilbert
piled proof upon proof, sometimes most cogently,
as when he constructed loadstone globes, or <i>terrellas</i>
to serve as magnetic models of the earth; sometimes
with indifferent logic, as when he pointed
to the iron ore in the earth and reasoned that the
magnet tended to conform to (<i>i.e.</i> turn itself toward)
the homogenic substance of the body from
which it had been dug. The local deviations of
the compass he sought to account for by the
irregularities of the earth's crust, and maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
that the compass tended always, at places off the
coast of a continent, to be deflected somewhat toward
that continent. His syllogism was based on
the fact that at that date all the way up the Atlantic
seaboard of Europe, from Morocco to Norway,
the variation was eastward. He argued that this
was a universal law. But even within one generation,
as may be seen in <i>Purchas his Pilgrims</i>, in
the narrative of the voyage of Bylot and Baffin,
the generality of the law was questioned. Gilbert
reasoned on such knowledge as he had, and this
did not include any notion of the secular changes
in the declination. In his time, as he tells us, the
variation of the compass at London was 11-1/3
degrees. What he did not know was that this
was a diminishing quantity which in fifty-seven
years would be reduced to zero, to be succeeded by
a westward declination that would last for nearly
three hundred years. For the facts as known in
the thirty years succeeding Gilbert's death, see the
remarkable and scarce volume of Gellibrand: <i>A
Discourse Mathematical on the Variation of the Magneticall
Needle</i> (1635).</p>

<p>Gilbert's treatise is a skilful literary achievement
in which there is no trace to reveal whether
any part was written before the rest. It is divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
systematically into six books. The sixth book
only appears to suffer from some incompleteness.
It relates not so much to the magnet as to the
Copernican theory of the universe, which doctrine
Gilbert had eagerly espoused, and which he was
the first in England to proclaim. It is known
from a letter to Barlow, printed in 1616, that he
intended to add to it certain chapters descriptive
of some of his instruments, but he had not completed
these before his death. The first book
treats of historic accounts of the loadstone, of its
origin and properties, of iron ores in general, and of
the fables and vain opinions which in the handling
of Paracelsus and of the schoolmen had grown up
around the magnet. The second book is on the
magnetic motions, and primarily on the attractions
and repulsions between loadstones, between
loadstone and iron, and between magnetic needles.
In this book occurs the notable digression upon
the subject of amber and the electric forces of
amber and of other substances which when rubbed
show, as he discovered, similar electrical powers.
An analysis of this part, and a summary of Gilbert's
electrical discoveries will be found in the
Notes printed for the Gilbert Club to accompany
the English translation (1900) of the <i>De Magnete</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
After this digression Gilbert returns to the attractive
properties of the loadstone, and to the way
they are affected by giving it different shapes.
In the course of this enquiry, he announces his
discovery of the augmentation of the power of
the loadstone by arming it with iron caps, an
invention which caused Galileo to say: "I extremely
praise, admire, and envy this author for
that a conception so stupendous should come into
his mind. I think him moreover worthy of extraordinary
applause for the many new and true
observations that he has made." Gilbert further
pointed out that the loadstone is surrounded by
a sort of atmosphere or "orbe of virtue" within
which the magnetical effects can be observed.
Book 3, on the directive force of the magnet, is
full of most instructive experiments, in which the
terrella figures largely, relating to the question
how one magnet influences another and tends to
make it point toward it. All this was leading up
to the theory of terrestrial magnetism; for we
find him naming the parts of his loadstone globes
with poles, equator and meridians. In this book
he dilates on the observation that vertical iron
rods, such as the finial on the Church of St. John
at Rimini, spontaneously acquired magnetic properties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
This he traced to the influence of the
earth, and demonstrated the effect by magnetizing
iron bars by simply hammering them on the anvil
while they lay in a north and south position. Book
4 deals with the Declination, or, as it was then
called, the variation of the compass. He discusses
its observation and measurement, the influence of
islands, the results obtained by travellers to distant
parts, Nova Zembla, the Guinea coast, the Canary
Isles, Florida, Virginia, Cape Race, and Brazil.
Then he recounts his experiments with terrellas
having uneven surfaces to represent the irregularities
of the earth's crust. He points out errors
arising from the fallacious practice of setting the
needle obliquely under the card. He considers in
separate chapters the variations in Nova Zembla,
in the Pacific, in the Mediterranean, and in the Eastern
Ocean. The fifth book is on the Dip. Gilbert
seized with avidity on Norman's discovery of this
effect, and devised an improved form of dipping-needle.
He experimented on the dip of compass-needles
placed at different points over his terrella,
and evolved a theory on the proportion which he
conceived to exist between the latitude and the
dip. Arguing from all too imperfect data, he
propounded the view that the dip was the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
in any given latitude; and proposed that seamen
should ascertain their latitudes by simply observing
the dip. He was aware that local irregularities
might occur, as they do in the declination;
but was not deterred by this knowledge from
propounding his theory with much circumstance
and considerable geometrical skill. After the publication
of his book he developed the theory still
further and gave it to Blundevile for publication.
At Gilbert's suggestion Briggs of Gresham College
calculated out a table of dip and latitude. It was,
however, soon found that the facts deviated more
or less widely from the theory. Further observations
in other lands showed the method to be
impracticable; and Gilbert's hope to give to the
mariner a magnetic measure of latitude remained
unfulfilled. Book 5 closes with an eloquent passage
in which Gilbert affirmed the neo-Platonic doctrine
of the animate nature of the universe, and
asserted that Thales was right when he held (as
Aristotle relates in the <i>De Anima</i>) that the loadstone
was animate, being part of and indeed the
choice offspring of its animate mother the earth.
Book 6, as already mentioned, is devoted to
Copernican ideas, and contains Gilbert's one contribution
to the science of Astronomy, in his remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
that the fixed stars (previously regarded as
fixed in the eighth of the celestial spheres at one
common distance from the central earth) were in
reality set in the heavens at various distances from
the earth.</p>

<p>From this brief analysis it will be seen that
Gilbert's claims to eminence rest not upon any
particular discovery or invention, but upon his
having built up a whole experimental magnetic
philosophy on a truly scientific basis, in place of
the vague and wild speculations which had previously
been accepted. By his magnificent generalization
from the small scale models to the globe
itself, supported from point to point by experimental
researches, he created the science of terrestrial
magnetism. If from the imperfection of
the data at his disposal he fell into sundry errors
of detail, he yet founded the method of philosophizing
by which those errors were in due time
corrected. And if for nothing else than his
masterly vindication of scientific method, and his
rescue of the subject of magnetism from the pedantry
and charlatanry into which in the preceding
ages it had lapsed, his memory must be held
in high honour.</p>

<p>Alas that of the personality of so great a man so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
little should be known. A brief but characteristic
biography of him is enshrined by old Fuller in his
<i>Worthies</i>. The poet Dryden, and the epigrammatist
Owen, celebrated him in still briefer verse.
His portrait, which hung for nigh two hundred
years in the Schools Gallery, at Oxford, disappeared
a century ago, leaving only a poor engraving to
perpetuate his scholarly countenance. Doubtless
he is one of the four physicians depicted by the
pencil of Camden in his famous cartoon (now in
the British Museum), as walking in the funeral
procession of Queen Elizabeth. Of his handwriting
not a vestige was known until about five years ago,
when a signature was unearthed in the Record
Office. Subsequently four signatures were found
in the books of St. John's College; and recently
there has come to light a volume of Aristotle
bearing Gilbert's own marginal notes. His will
lies at Somerset House, but it is only a copy. Of
his fine collection of minerals and loadstones, which
with his maps, books, manuscripts, and correspondence
with Sarpi and Sagredo and others, he bequeathed
to the College of Physicians, nothing
remains: they perisht in the Great Fire of London.
In a quiet corner of the City of Colchester stands
the quaint old house where he lived, and where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
according to local tradition, he once received the
Queen. And hard by it is the church of Holy
Trinity, in which a mural tablet records his virtues
and marks his last resting place. But his true
monument is the immortal treatise in which he
laid the foundations of terrestrial magnetism and
of the experimental science of electricity.</p>

<p>To the names of the men who made great the
age of Queen Elizabeth, who added lustre to the
England over which she ruled, and made it famous
in foreign discovery, in sea-craft, in literature, in
poetry, and in drama, must be joined that of the
man who equally added lustre in science, Doctor
William Gilbert.</p>
